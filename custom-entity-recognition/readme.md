# Extract custom entities

Using NLP with Azure AI Language Services you can define custom entities, and extract instances of them from text.

To test the custom entity extraction, we'll create a model and train it through Azure AI Language Studio, then use a command line application to test it.


    **Python**:

    ```
    pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
