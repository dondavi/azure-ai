# Translate Speech
Azure AI Speech includes a speech translation API that you can use to translate spoken language. For example, suppose you want to develop a translator application that people can use when traveling in places where they don't speak the local language. They would be able to say phrases such as "Where is the station?" or "I need to find a pharmacy" in their designated language, and have it translate them to the local language. Testing with Spanish, French and Hindi.
