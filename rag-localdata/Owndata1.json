It is important to define a career trajectory and create an environment where both engineers can own significant parts of the project, make architectural decisions, and develop trust in their expertise [doc4]. \n\nYou might consider organizing the team around specific product areas or functionalities, possibly forming a small, cross-functional pod that allows both developers to work independently and efficiently [doc1]. Additionally, fostering open communication and ensuring both engineers are aligned on goals and expectations will help build a strong foundation for your team .\n\nSince the team is small, emphasizing generalist skills and encouraging rotation or collaboration on different tasks can also be beneficial, especially if you plan to grow the team later . Creating a shared understanding of decision-making processes and promoting buy-in from both developers will be key to establishing a productive and cohesive engineering group .\n\n**References:**  \n[doc1], [doc4], [doc5]",

This same principle\n\napplies to testing, developer experience, etc.\n\nSpecialize with scale: Until your team is north of a dozen people, chances are high that you're better off with a team of\n\nprimarily generalists.\n\nHere are some rough numbers for team composition based on startup experience:\n\nTeam size 1 5\n\nYour team is all generalists, specialized at most between frontend, backend, and mobile.\n\nTeam size 5 15\n\nYour team is specialized by product or general skill area such as backend, frontend architecture, frontend\n\ndesign, DevOps, and testing.\n\nYou'll likely want to start thinking about dedicated resources in testing and DevOps when you've grown to\n\n(or past) fifteen engineers.\n\nTeam size 15 30\n\nYou should have real specialization by this point and be hiring only people with expertise in a subfield of\n\nsoftware engineering.\n\nAt this point, any inefficiencies in how work gets done are likely to start getting very expensive across the\n\nteam, so make sure you're investing either headcount or time in ensuring that developers are able to get\n\nwork done, their tools work, and operational logistics are streamlined.\n\nTeam size 30-plus\n\nAt this stage there are many methodologies for breaking out teams into smaller units to ensure work stays\n\nefficient. If you have multiple product lines, aligning team members with specific product lines is a fairly\n\nnatural place to start organizing.\n\nMany companies at this stage use a concept of pods, where a pod has a focus area and is made up of a\n\ndiverse/cross-functional team capable of independently executing tasks in that area.\n\nProject Maintenance: The Two Crews Philosophy",

In particular, working on a customer crew exposes an engineer to a huge amount of code, often\n\noffers opportunities to talk to customers, and involves less product-driven deadline pressure all things that\n\nmight appeal to the right candidate.\n\nCreate an explicitly discussed career trajectory for engineers to start on the customer crew and, after a period of\n\ntime (usually twelve-plus months), transfer to the feature crew.\n\nEngineers rotate between the crews on a regular basis. The Microsoft blog post referenced above recommends\n\nswapping some team members between the two crews every week.\n\nDefine the customer crew as a temporary team. This can mean either that the customer crew itself doesn't exist\n\nfull-time (perhaps for only one week per month), or that team members are constantly rotating between the\n\ncustomer and feature crews.\n\n\n\nI recommend creating a dedicated, permanent customer crew only for teams or products where customer issues are\n\ncostly enough for the team to warrant it. If you're in a high-support business, a dedicated customer crew can be a force\n\nmultiplier for both engineering productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\nTeam Organization\nIn general, you'll find technical organization charts organized in one of two ways: functional organization and product\n\norganization. A functional group is organized around the type of work team members do, such as frontend engineering,\n\ntesting, or a particular internal service. Product groupings, sometimes called business units, are organized around a\n\nparticular business-related/product focus, such as the enterprise core application team or the consumer mobile app team.\n\nHow you choose to organize your team can have a significant impact on team collaboration, productivity, and morale.\n\nProduct-organized teams, often called pods, are the right answer most of the time.\n\nWhen you're designing an organization chart you should consider what you're optimizing for.

They should be able to develop trust that they can not only build incremental\n\nfeatures but own and make good decisions in architecture for new greenfield projects. Since the key value these two\n\ntypes of roles offer is so different, it should follow that your interviews for them should be different.\n\nFor a senior hire, the focus interview where you deeply explore the candidate's decision-making skills, understanding of\n\nconcepts, and architectural know-how is critical and should be weighed heavily. For a junior role, that knowledge deep-\n\ndive should be shorter, and weighed less heavily than a practical coding exercise.\n\nThe Interview Itself\n\nThe senior software engineer technical focus interview is typically a sixty to ninety-minute conversation between the\n\ncandidate and a lead interviewer, ideally with a primarily silent second interviewer on hand to take notes. Depending on\n\nthe length of your focus guide and how many subjects you want to cover, you may consider splitting out the subjects into\n\nmultiple focus interviews.\n\nI emphasize that this interview should be conversational; you're looking to find out which areas of software engineering\n\nthe candidate is most knowledgeable and passionate about, and in which areas they've either never been held\n\naccountable or have historically delegated. Doing this does not require brainteasers, pair programming, or any problem-\n\nsolving. Simply ask!\n\nStart the interview informally with some light conversation. After a minute or two, begin describing the agenda/plan for the\n\nmeeting. Let the candidate know you have a document with an interview guide in it, and your goal is to get the candidate\n\nto discuss the topics in that guide over the next sixty to seventy-five minutes, leaving fifteen minutes at the end for them\n\nto ask you questions.\n\nAfter the preamble you'll jump into the first section of the interview guide.",

The third approach is a compromise between the first\n\ntwo: develop a draft yourself and present it as a straw man to the team as a starting point for collecting feedback and\n\niterating to get to a final version. The key differences between these techniques are the amount of time they take, and\n\nhow much buy-in you get from the team. And I encourage you to optimize for buy-in: ensuring everyone on your team\n\nunderstands decisions and can be a champion for those decisions is the only way to ensure you're all marching in the\n\nsame direction. As Marty Cagan of Silicon Valley Product Group calls it, you want your team to behave like missionaries,\n\nnot mercenaries.\n\nThe Independent Model: Developing independently as a manager takes the least overall time, but also produces the\n\nleast buy-in.\n\nThe Straw Man Model: Codeveloping decisions starting with a straw man takes a medium amount of time, and\n\ndepending on execution can produce healthy buy-in.\n\nThe Codevelopment Model: Developing collectively from scratch can take a significant amount of time, though it\n\nproduces the most buy-in from those who contributed to the development.\n\nWhich model you use for any given decision is up to you, and I encourage you to be thoughtful and deliberate about that\n\nchoice. Don't be afraid to revisit it if you feel you've chosen the wrong model.\n\nTwo Types of Decisions\n\nIn an annual letter to shareholders in 1997, Jeff Bezos outlined a framework for classifying decisions into Type 1 and\n\nType 2 decisions. Type 1 decisions are not reversible, and should be thought through methodically, carefully, slowly, and\n\nwith great deliberation and consultation, Bezos wrote. If you walk through a door and don't like what you see on the other\n\nside, you can't get back to where you were before. Which programming language you use, for example, is a Type 1\n\ndecision.\n\nType 2 decisions are the opposite.",
