This helps streamline accountability and decision-making [doc4].\n\n2. **Processes and Procedures Documentation**: Maintain well-defined and accessible processes and procedures for operational tasks. These should be stored centrally, regularly updated, and assigned to specific owners to facilitate consistency and quick onboarding [doc2].\n\n3. **Change Management**: Establish mechanisms to request, review, and approve additions, changes, and exceptions to processes, procedures, and resources. This enables deliberate decision-making based on benefits and risks [doc4].\n\n4. **Automation and Scripts as Code**: Where possible, implement scripts, templates, and automation documents as code to reduce manual errors and improve repeatability [doc2].\n\n5. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Track the performance of operations, identify defects or inefficiencies, and implement feedback mechanisms for iterative improvement [doc3].\n\n6. **Ownership and Discoverability**: Document ownership of workloads, resources, and processes, making this information discoverable to all team members. Regular review and updates are necessary to adapt to organizational changes [doc3].\n\nThese processes form the foundation of a minimal DevOps approach, ensuring operational stability, accountability, and continuous improvement .",
